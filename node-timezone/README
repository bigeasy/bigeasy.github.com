NODE TIMEZONE

Development tasks:

 * Parse Olson file.
 * Create searchable structure for offsets and rules.
 * Create Olson file compiler utility.
 * Create tests with controls generated by a mature timezone library such as
   CPAN's DateTime::TimeZone or UNIX `date`.
 * Create a timezone conversion method.
 * Create a date offset method.
 * Create French and German locales to seed the locale set.

Decisions:

 * Olson files are compiled into JSON, loaded as JSON.
 * On the browser side, it is the job of the client to initialize the timezone
   data, to load it and whatnot.
 * In Node.js, timezone data is loaded *synchonously* as needed, or at startup. 
 * Make a magic function that does format, parse and date math based on
   parameter order, to simplify import and minimize burden on namespace.
